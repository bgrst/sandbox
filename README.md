##dear GiTusers, i've never coded and now I need help
about me: woman, human, do not know notes, but love music; do not sew but enjoy clothing, so hopefully...
## now I need your advice for my hello world project (imma lack of skills):
- one image should be inserted like the one below, better is to give an external img link or to store it somewhere inside this project in a say repository? Unix Mint is my OS,alas :(
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa#/media/File:Mona_Lisa,_by_Leonardo_da_Vinci,_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg
- i need a submit form with text or weblink result, where to base a database of results and whom to fork for some example? Have experience with G Forms and Tables 
thank you in advance
